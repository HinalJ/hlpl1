class Token {
public:
	char kind;
	double value;
};

kind:  '+', '-', '*', '/', '8'
value: N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, "value stored in double".

Maybe we use vectors to store all tokens and then when we see operators like '*' we mulitply previous and later one 
But still how to implement Mathematics rules? Answer is Grammar!!!

// a simple expression grammar:

Expression:
	Term
	Expression "+" Term // addition
	Expression "–" Term // subtraction
Term:
	Primary
	Term "*" Primary // multiplication
	Term "/" Primary // division
Primary:
	Number
	"(" Expression ")" // grouping
Number:
	floating-point-literal

This is a set of simple rules!
